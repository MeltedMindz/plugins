# Security Documentation

This document describes the security model, permissions, and data handling for Recall.

## Overview

Recall is designed with privacy and minimal permissions in mind. All data is stored locally, no network access is required, and file contents are never captured.

## Data Stored

### What IS Captured

| Data | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| File paths | Track which files decisions relate to | `src/store/index.ts` |
| Reasoning text | Your explanation of the decision | "Using Zustand for simpler API" |
| Tags | Categorization for searchability | `#state-management` |
| Timestamps | When decisions were recorded | `2026-01-14T10:30:00Z` |
| Git commit hashes | Link decisions to code changes | `abc1234` |
| Project paths | Organize decisions by project | `/Users/you/project` |

### What is NOT Captured

| Data | Reason |
|------|--------|
| File contents | Not needed; paths are sufficient |
| Source code | Privacy; you describe changes in your words |
| Environment variables | Security; could contain secrets |
| Credentials | Never accessed or stored |
| Network data | No network access required |

## Permissions

### Claude Code Plugin

The plugin requires:

| Permission | Scope | Justification |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| Hook execution | PostToolUse events | Detect architectural changes |
| File read | hooks.json, scripts | Load configuration |
| Process spawn | Node.js for scripts | Run detection logic |

The plugin does NOT require:
- Network access
- Write access outside plugin directory
- Access to credentials or secrets

### MCP Server

The server requires:

| Permission | Scope | Justification |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| Filesystem read | `~/.recall/` | Read decision database |
| Filesystem write | `~/.recall/` | Store decisions |
| Process spawn | `git` command | Get commit hashes (optional) |

The server does NOT require:
- Network access
- Access to source code
- Access to credentials or secrets

## Storage Security

### Database Location

```
~/.recall/decisions.db
```

This is a SQLite database with:
- Standard file permissions (readable/writable by owner)
- WAL mode for safe concurrent access
- No encryption (data is not sensitive)

### Backup Considerations

The database can be safely backed up using standard file copy. To export decisions for archival:

```
# In Claude Desktop
export_decisions with format: "json"
```

## Git Integration

### What's Accessed

- Current commit hash via `git rev-parse HEAD`
- Remote URL via `git remote get-url origin`
- Commit existence check via `git rev-parse --verify`

### What's NOT Accessed

- Git credentials
- SSH keys
- Full git history
- File diffs

### Failure Mode

If git is not available or the directory is not a repository, the plugin continues to work without commit linking. No errors are shown to the user.

## Hook Security

### PostToolUse Hook

The hook receives:
- Tool name (Write, Edit, etc.)
- File path from tool result
- Success/failure status

The hook does NOT receive:
- File contents
- Tool input parameters (e.g., what was written)

### Script Execution

Hook scripts run as Node.js processes with:
- No network access
- Read access to stdin (tool result)
- Write access to stdout (detection result)
- No access to user files outside plugin

## Privacy Guarantees

1. **No telemetry**: Recall does not phone home or report usage
2. **No cloud storage**: All data stays on your machine
3. **No file reading**: Only paths are captured, never contents
4. **User-controlled**: You decide what reasoning to record
5. **Deletable**: Remove `~/.recall/` to erase all data

## Threat Model

### In Scope

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Accidental secret capture | Only user-written reasoning stored |
| Data exfiltration | No network access |
| Unauthorized access | Standard file permissions |
| Database corruption | WAL mode, standard SQLite reliability |

### Out of Scope

| Threat | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| Malicious MCP client | Trusts MCP protocol integrity |
| Compromised Node.js | System-level security concern |
| Physical access | Standard OS security |

## Audit Log

Decisions include timestamps for audit purposes:
- `created_at`: When decision was recorded
- `updated_at`: When decision was modified
- `commit_hash`: Git commit for code traceability

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:
1. Opening a private issue on GitHub
2. Emailing the maintainers directly

Do not disclose security issues publicly until they've been addressed.

## Compliance Notes

Recall:
- Stores no PII beyond file paths
- Requires no special data handling
- Can be fully deleted by removing `~/.recall/`
- Leaves no residual data after uninstallation
